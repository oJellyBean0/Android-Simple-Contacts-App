## Objectives:

```
 Introduction to Android
 Multiple Activities
```

In last week’s assignment, you were tasked with creating an app that would allow you to manage
your contacts. In this assignment, you are to modify the app, such that:

```
 instead of a single Activity that allows the user to add and view contacts, the app must have
two Activities, a Contacts List activity and a Contact Editing activity;
 the user of the app can browse the list of contacts using the Contacts List activity (by
scrolling through the list of contacts), view a contact (by tapping on a contact in the list) or
add a new contact (by clicking on the + button). It must still be possible to search and sort
the contacts as in the previous assignment;
 the Contact Editing Activity will be used for viewing, editing or deleting a contact. The
activity will be started in view mode by default, unless the parameter editing = true is passed
through when the activity starts (e.g. when adding a new contact). In both view and editing
mode, the contact’s details must be passed through as a parameter. In view mode, a contact
may be edited by clicking on an edit button. Editing continues until the user clicks on the
save button. Clicking on the delete button will ask whether the user wishes to delete the
current contact or not (check out the Alert Dialog provided by Android). The activity will
return (to the Contacts List activity) the current contact’s details, a flag to indicate whether
the contact was edited or not and a flag to indicate whether the contact is to be deleted or
not.
